    <p>Dafny is a language that is designed to make it easy to
    write correct code. This means correct in the sense of not having any runtime
    errors, but also correct in actually doing what the programmer intended it to
    do. To accomplish this, Dafny relies on high-level annotations to reason about
    and prove correctness of code. The effect of a piece of code can be given abstractly,
    using a natural, high-level expression of the desired behavior, which is easier
    and less error prone to write. Dafny then generates a proof that the code
    matches the annotations (assuming they are correct, of course!). Dafny lifts the
    burden of writing bug-free <em>code</em> into that of writing bug-free <em>annotations</em>.
    This is often easier than writing the code, because annotations are shorter and
    more direct. For example, the following fragment of annotation in Dafny says
    that every element of the array is strictly positive:</p>
    
    <pre><code id="bigcode">forall k: int :: 0 &lt;= k &lt; a.Length ==&gt; 0 &lt; a[k]</code></pre>
    
    <p>This says that for all integers <code id="smallcode">k</code>
    that are indices into the array, the value at that index is greater than zero.
    By writing these annotations, one is confident that the code is correct.
    Further, the very act of writing the annotations can help one understand what the
    code is doing at a deeper level.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to proving a correspondence to user supplied
    annotations, Dafny proves that there are no run time errors, such as index out
    of bounds, null dereferences, division by zero, etc. This guarantee is a
    powerful one, and is a strong case in and of itself for the use of Dafny and
    tools like it. Dafny also proves the termination of code, except in specially
    designated loops.</p>
